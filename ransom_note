Problem Statement
Given the words in the magazine and the words in the ransom note, 
print Yes if he can replicate his ransom note exactly using whole 
words from the magazine; otherwise, print No.

For example, the note is "Attack at dawn". The magazine contains only 
"attack at dawn". The magazine has all the right words, but there's a case 
mismatch. The answer is No.
