Problem Statement:
You are given an array of size N having no duplicate elements. 
The array can be categorized into following:
1.  Ascending
2.  Descending
3.  Descending Rotated
4.  Ascending Rotated
Print which type of array it is and the maximum element of that array.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no test cases. 
Then T test caes follow. Each testcase contains two lines of input. 
The first line contains an integer N denoting the size of the array. 
The next line contains N space separated values of the array.

Output:
For each test case, print the largest element in the array 
and and integer x denoting the type of the array.

arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
arr2 = [5,4,3,2,1]
flag=1
for i in range(len(arr1)-2):
    while(arr[i]<arr[i+1]):
        flag=0
if(flag==1):
    print("Descending")
else:
    print("Ascending")
