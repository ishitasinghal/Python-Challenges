Professor Utonium is restless because of the increasing crime in the world.

Girl. Professor has all the N ingredients in his laboratory and knows the quantity 
of each available ingredient. He also knows the quantity of a particular ingredient

Utonium from creating more Powerpuff girls. Mojo Jojo is coming prepared with ammunition 
and Him is leading other villains like Princess, Amoeba Boys, Sedusa, Gangreen Gang etc.


Professor does not have much time as villains will reach the laboratory soon. He is starting
